# The Cacophony
[Hack the Midlands 2018](http://hackthemidlands.co.uk) project by a small team from [Ubisoft Leamington](https://reflections.ubisoft.com/about/ubisoft-leamington/)

A webpage is served to multiple web clients with a full-rotation dial. The dial value is treated as the angle to move an object in, on a game running in Unity. The object in the game moves according to the summation of all the angles provided by all the players. It moves faster when players agree on the angle. The more contradicting the angles provided by players, the worse the sounds of the moving object... hence The Cacophony.

The project uses Unity, Django, WebSockets, HTML, JavaScript, and [jQuery-Control](https://github.com/aterrien/jQuery-Kontrol)

No animals were harmed as part of this project.
